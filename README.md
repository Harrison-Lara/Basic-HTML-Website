# Basic-HTML-Website

The web application must use HTML 5 and CSS for page content and layout. Pages
must be properly formatted using the HTML 5 specification. Tables are not to be used
for general content layout. Tables can and should only be used for tabular information.
CSS must be used for styling the content and doing the visual layout. An HTML5
DOCTYPE is required with the 5 required tags.
2. The pages/sections that make up the web application must have a consistent
design/interface. There should be elements of each page/section that they share in
common such as a header, menu, footer, etc. You have flexibility in how you
implement your design, but it should not just be a random set of page/section designs.
The user should have a consistent and understandable experience when moving from
page to page, section to section, or application function to application function.
3. The web application must be well-structured and logically organized. Changes to
common elements in a page design must be easy to implement. A common element
is an element that is repeated on multiple (or all) pages/sections such as a header,
menu, and/or footer. If a common element has to be changed by editing it in
multiple places in the code, then your implementation is not correct.
4. The web application must have content or functions that are publicly available and
content or functions that can only be accessed if authenticated (logged-in), public and
private content. When a user is logged-in they must have some visual cue that
indicates they are logged-in. The ability to logout must be available. After the user
logs out or if they never log in, they must not be able to access the protected pages
or functions.
5. For the purpose of testing the login and accessing the protected content the
following user ID and password must work for general access to protected
content:
o User ID: test
o Password: pass
o If you need to implement a separate login for administrative features or a
different category of user, then supply the login credentials that are necessary
to perform the login in the document.
6. The web application must utilize PHP and proper PHP techniques shown in class.
7. You must properly use GET and POST. Using GET for private information is not
acceptable. GET should not be used to take an action such as deleting information or
submitting a password. Remember that GET places the information in the URL and
should be used for retrieval!
8. The web application must use form elements beyond what is needed for a login form.
9. Any place where users can provide input you must supply appropriate and informative
feedback if the information entered is not complete or correct. For example, if the
user provides incorrect login information they should receive feedback that the login
failed...not just be re-presented with an empty login form with no message.

10. The web application must contain a page where there are multiple photos presented
on the page.
11. The web application must contain a page that contains a YouTube or another video
embedded in the page.
12. The web application must utilize JavaScript and proper JavaScript techniques as
shown in class.
13. The web application must utilize jQuery and proper jQuery techniques as shown in
class.
14. The web application must utilize jQuery UI or Bootstrap interface elements. This
means jQuery UI functions like .draggable() or .button().Not a jQuery template. If a
template is used then you will receive a zero for the score.
15. The web application must utilize AJAX. AJAX can be implemented using jQuery or the
capabilities provided by JavaScript.
16. The web application you build is not to be trivial in simply meeting the technical
requirements set forth in this document. Yes, you are to meet the requirements but
you are also to build a web application that has a purpose and delivers functionality
or capability. The requirements are parameters to be used in design and
implementation of the application; they are not intended to be the end product. You
should build a web application that you would be happy to show a prospective
employer or client. You should also make sure that you can complete the development
by the due date.
